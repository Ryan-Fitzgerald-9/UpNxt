# UpNxt
With seemingly endless options for streaming, finding the next movie or show to watch can take almost as long as a feature film. UpNxt provides movies/shows availability across all your favorite streaming apps to save you time from swapping between each over and over. Users can provide their own scroes and reviews as well.
